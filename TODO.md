## TODO i3

 - Consider pango, i3blocks others for statusbar formatting
 - Replace i3bar with EG GNOMEpanel or alternative. See https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_configuring_i3bar point 1
 - Add i3lock? Advantage of not using is easy option to swap back to gnome at login screen :)

 - Add wallpaper w/ feh, hsetroot or others
 - Get compton working for effects. See inspo and below link. WIll also stop tearing. 
 - Do monitor config with GUI here - arandr https://geekoverdose.wordpress.com/2017/02/05/i3-window-manager-setup-and-configuration/ 
 - GUI wifi config (only needed on a host, otherwise VMware handles virtually) https://geekoverdose.wordpress.com/2017/02/05/i3-window-manager-setup-and-configuration/
 - Consider dmenu instead of rofi - same link
 - Default terminal info, pretty https://samsaffron.com/archive/2019/04/09/my-i3-window-manager-setup  
 - dmenu calculator https://www.reddit.com/r/i3wm/comments/hgnvkv/dmenurs_now_has_a_built_in_calculator_one_that_is/ 
 - Polybar not i3status https://polybar.github.io/
